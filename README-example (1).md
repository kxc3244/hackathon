Our open data source  is from the CDC (https://data.cdc.gov/).

## <a name="importance"></a>Why is this important?

This is important because COVID-19 ( commonly known as the coronavirus), effects where people travel to, and our web-app makes it easily accesable for the public to have revelent information of the coronavirus, and provides advice to whether or not travel to a particular country. An Informed decision to move, will help decrease the possible spread of disease.
